​	In the last few days, I just finished the reptils.So I pulled all the work in our team and glanced over them.After that I continued to finish the front-end job.

​	However, I installed some important software before that, even though it seemed not successful.

​	I adjusted css style and clone some pages from github.the below are what I have found:
